## Outside code
  * Downloaded "The Great Noun List" from <http://www.desiquintans.com/nounlist>. The website confirms I can use this file for this purpose. I did modify the list to remove all words that were hyphenated to prevent confusion since the individual words in the password will be shown separated by a -.
  * Referenced the approved symbols for passwords from the Open Web Application Security Project <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters>
